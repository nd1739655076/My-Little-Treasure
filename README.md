# My Little Treasure

## How to run the program

The program should be run only from index.html or SignUp.html pages, which are the login and sign-up pages respectively. A quick way to run the program is to pull the repository into a folder, open the folder in VS Code and open the html file using “Open with Live Server” (an easy-to-get Live Server extension in VS Code). 

## Inspiration
Through find the inspiration of the project online, we find some really interesting statistics. Only 49% of women know how compound interest works, against 75% of men. Almost 60% of women do not know that high investment returns are accompanied by high risk, against 45% of men. 85% of non-married women save informally, compared to 75% of non-married men. 32% of women (and 29% of men) with low financial literacy are likely to engage in problematic credit card behaviours.

## What it does
Users can easily set username and password to sign up for an account and log in using that account. We use localstorage to store the data.

In addition to the login and signup interface, we also designed a dashboard, so that users can choose the functions they want.

In addition, the site was designed with 3 main functions, namely Bookkeeping functionality: i.e., three variables are used to track the user's budget, expenses, and balance. The data will be retained each time the user logs out of the account.

Interest Function: We use the user's inputs of interest rate per annum, principal amount, and then we can perfectly calculate the profit that the user can earn. This feature makes it easy to manage your money.

Money Saving Plan: We will generate a money saving plan by using the name of the program entered by the user, the amount of money user wants to save for each period of time (per day/week/month/year), and the each period of time (per day/week/month/year). The savings plan will be recorded in the user's data. When the user logs in again, user will be able to see the previous plan as well.

## How we built it
We used a combination of html and css to build our webpage interface, and java script to enable receiving and processing input, and providing meaningful feedback. We used the localstorage to store the data input, so that after refreshing the page, logging out and logging back in, or restarting the web application, our users can still access their previous data. We also used Git and GitHub as our team development tool to divide and combine our work.

## Challenges we ran into
We were never able to create a remotely connected Database. In web development, we encountered the problem of not being able to store the user's data, but we finally solved the problem perfectly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Before the Hackathon, we had almost zero bases of front-end and web page development, since we are all sophomores in computer science major and cybersecurity major. We learned a little about database management and HTML connection to the back-end part. However, after making our plan to build a finance website, we learned this knowledge within 8 hours. Every group member paid a lot and finally finished the project.

## What we learned
We learned the programming languages needed for web development (HTML, CSS, JavaSrcipt). And the process required for website development.

## What's next for My Little Treasure
Make a stronger database based on SQL to make our user's data more safe and stable, which can also give our database the ability to store a larger amount of data.
Improve the design of UI, which can give users a better visual experience while using our website and can also introduce different functions more clearly.
Develop more functions to make progress in user experiences, such as changing account info, a summary of the budget and foundation plan which are shown on the dashboard, forgetting passwords, and also credit card knowledge
